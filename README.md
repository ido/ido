### Hello!

I'm Ido Rosen.  I work on things that intersect economics/finance, machine learning/"AI", statistics, optimization, and (optionally) distributed systems.  If you're trying to reach me, [email ðŸ“«](mailto:code@idorosen.com) is the best way.  (If I don't respond within 48 hours, please try again - my spam filter can be over-eager.)
